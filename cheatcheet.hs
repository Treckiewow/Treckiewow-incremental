kardashev scale
1: Harvests all energy from the home planet
2: havesting all the energy from the star+planetary system       (dyson sphere)
3: Harvests all energy from the galaxy                           (lots of building spheres)
4: Harvests all energy from multiple galaxies
5: reaches superclusters
Type Omega: Controls vast sections of the universe, maybe even created it, and or other universes.

Exotic matter = Wormholes?

 It would be cool to see an area below the tech tree with something representing the purchased buildings (so that when I'm viewing the Energy tab I can see that I have 1 Lab, 2 Solar Panals etc). What if there were limited slots in it too? So you were forced to replace lower yield buildings with higher ones to be more efficient? (e.g. 12 slots available for buildings and each building occupied 1 or more slots; so you might start by buying lots of Solar Panels but later have to replace them to make room for more important buildings and have to make choices about what to keep and what to discard).



% in front of shop stuff to show % of total production

Effects:
High damage     Low speed
low damage		high speed
low damage		high range
high damage		low range
high dammage + small DoT
low damage + big DoT
chance to critt
chain lightning
splash
slow/freeze
chance to make other production stronger for a tick?

each building produces more than those before
produces 1-100% every tick
chance to stop production for a tick
every 800 tick produces high value
increase tickrate
spells that empowers
discount every second not bought
every x ticks,higher % production for some seconds

TO DO:


Maybe:
moon drills and forward higher cost.
upgrading energy buildings give 200% energy%
